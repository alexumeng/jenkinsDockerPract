Apex Legends is focused on the stories of the various Legends that participate in the Apex Games, a highly popular, televised blood sport that is owned by the mysterious Mercenary Syndicate and managed by their Apex Games Commission headed by Kuben Blisk.

The Apex Games were initially hosted on Kings Canyon, an island located on the planet Solace. Construction of the arena for the games commenced some time in 2727 and was finished a year after, after which time the games presumably started. The arena at Kings Canyon has been used for 124 seasons, until an attack on the island's Repulsor Tower by Crypto allowed the entry of wildlife, resulting in a devastated arena.[1] The match, then in-progress, was halted and the legends evacuated. The Syndicate suspended the games after the attack and proceeded to make various modifications to the arena in order to increase viewership and contain the wildlife that invaded the island.[2] Various disturbances were reported within the arena, following the resumption of the games[3], which forced the Syndicate to relocate the games to World's Edge, another arena on the planet Talos.[4]

Following this move, a sponsorship was struck up with the "new" Hammond Robotics, one of the companies that used to make up the now-defunct IMC. This coincided with the entry of Forge, a legend sponsored by Hammond Robotics and the introduction of the Planetary Harvester to World's Edge. Before his entry into the games, however, he was assassinated by Revenant.[5] This, alongside the various reported break-ins on Hammond facilities and the fact that Revenant has a vendetta against both the Syndicate and Hammond, Jacob Young and Cheryl Amacci found a way to contain the simulacrum by allowing him to join the games.
